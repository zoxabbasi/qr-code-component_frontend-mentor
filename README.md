## My process

- I used CSS grid twice in the project. First grid was used to centre the QR-code component vertically and horizontally in the page. Second one was to position the item on the QR-code component.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS GRID
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What I have learned the most, is the use of devtools for development process.

### Continued development

I should would more with CSS grid to get a better understanding of it.
